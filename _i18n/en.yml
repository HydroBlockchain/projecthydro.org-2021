# first section
hydro_title: Project Hydro
hydro_is: Hydro is a decentralized ecosystem using cutting-edge cryptography to secure user accounts, identities, and transactions.

# ecosystem section
ecosystem_title: Ecosystem
ecosystem_subline: Multi-chain protocols securing the web3 reality.

# multichains section
multichains_title: Multichained Protocols
multichains_subline: Leverage the full power of Hydro by using multiple chains.
tokenomics_chains_title: Chains
tokenomics_chains_subline: The Hydro protocols are available to use on multiple networks. 
  All of our protocols and dApps are powered by Hydro tokens.
tokenomics_bridge_title: Bridge
tokenomics_bridge_subline: Hydro has a total supply of 111,111,111 which was elected by its community. 
  The distribution between chains is handled by our bridge that swaps your tokens between chains. 
  Once the swap from one chain to another is complete you are free to enjoy the benefits of your chosen network.
tokenomics_evaporation_title: Evaporation
tokenomics_evaporation_subline: All of the Hydro tokens that are consumed by a Smart Contract will evaporate, 
  hence the supply will continously decrease over time.

# protocols description
raindrop_text: Raindrop is an authentication protocol which vastly improves upon current
  2FA standards with decentralized public blockchain security for logins,
  transactions, and payments.
snowflake_text: Snowflake is an identity protocol designed to protect private data from
  identity theft on the blockchain by providing a major barrier to identity
  theft attempts.
ice_text: Ice is a document signing and verification protocol which will allow users
  to stamp, authenticate, verify and seal any document or contract that is
  sent.
tide_text: Tide is a payment protocol which will allow for one-click authorization of
  debit and credit POS transactions, as well as instantaneous p2p, p2b, and
  b2b payments across the blockchain.
hail_text: Hail is tokenization on the blockchain. Under the hood it is a framework of
  Solidity Smart Contracts which work on top of the Hydro Snowflake protocol.
mist_text: Mist is an artificial intelligence that will create data
  modeling of transactions to enable fraud detection on the blockchain and safeguard clients from losing funds.
